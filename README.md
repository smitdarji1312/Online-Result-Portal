# Student-Result-Management-System-Java
It is a web application , which has two sides admin (Professor ) and User(Student). Admin can add the result into database and add student details ad well see the student details. Where as user can see their result using their own roll number. I have created this web application using Java,RDBMS and Html,css,Javascript,JQuery.
